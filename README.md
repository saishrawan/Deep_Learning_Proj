# Deep_Learning_Proj:

Project1: 
This project is on image classification for noisy MNIST dataset. When we add noise to images in the MNIST dataset, the digits in the images become more and more difficult for human to recognize. For example, the images here have increasingly large noise levels. However, interestingly, deep neural networks can still be trained to recognize them relatively well.
My task is to train a good hand-written-digit recognition classifier for the noisy images.
